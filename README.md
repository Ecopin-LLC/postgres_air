# postgres\_air
 This repo contains components for building the postgres_air database, 
  which can be used for training and various performance experiments.
  The database is created by h_DB_n  (Hettie DOmbrovskaya & Boris Novikov) 
  
## The db dumps of core data can be found here:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13F7M80Kf_somnjb-mTYAnh1hW1Y_g4kJ?usp=sharing

This shared directory contains data dump of the postgres_air schema in two formats: 
directory format and standard pg_dump format. The total size is about 1.2 GB in both cases,
but the directory has smaller files to download.

 ## Disclaimer
 
 Hettie & Boris do not guarantee the 100% accuracy of the data.
 We tried our best, but is is still possible that some airports ended up in the wrong cities
 and some cities ended up in the wrong countries.
 No offense intended in any of the above cases!
 
 Use at your own risk.
